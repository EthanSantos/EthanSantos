# hi there 👋 i'm ethan santos

I'm a third-year Computer Science major at UC Irvine with a deep passion for web development and game development. My programming journey began in late 2016, and since then, I've grown my skills and expertise across various technologies.

### my journey 🚀
- **game development:**  
  I started developing games on the ROBLOX platform and created my first successful game during quarantine in 2020 called **AIMSTARS**.  
  - **achievements:** 🏆 
    - Amassed over **9 million plays**.  
    - Generated more than **$30,000 in revenue**.  
    - Check it out here: [AIMSTARS](https://www.roblox.com/games/5153937061/AIMSTARS-FPS-AIM-TRAINER).

- **web development:**  
  I've participated in multiple hackathons, winning **4 hackathons**, which has sharpened my skills and fostered creativity in building innovative projects.

- **mobile development:**  
  During my internship at **Blue Social**, I worked with React Native to develop mobile applications.  
  I’ve also worked on personal projects, such as a fitness tracker app, to further grow my hands-on experience in mobile development.
