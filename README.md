# Hi there 👋 I'm Ethan Santos

## About Me 😎
I'm a third-year Computer Science major at UC Irvine with a deep passion for web development and game development. My programming journey began in late 2016, and since then, I've grown my skills and expertise across various technologies.

### My Journey 🚀
- **Game Development:** I started developing games on the ROBLOX platform and created my first successful game during quarantine in 2020 called **AIMSTARS**. I am proud to share that the game has amassed over 9 million plays and generated more than $30,000 in revenue. Check it out here!

- **Web Development:** I've been diving into web development, participating in multiple hackathons, and currently have 3 wins under my belt. These experiences have sharpened my skills and fostered my creativity in building innovative projects.

## Technologies ⚡
- Front-end development using **React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS**.
