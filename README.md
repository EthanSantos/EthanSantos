# Hi there 👋 I'm Ethan Santos

## About Me 😎
I'm a third-year Computer Science major at UC Irvine with a deep passion for web development and game development. My programming journey began in late 2016, and since then, I've grown my skills and expertise across various technologies.

### My Journey 🚀
- **Game Development:** I started developing games on the ROBLOX platform and created my first successful game during quarantine in 2020 called **AIMSTARS**. I am proud to share that the game has amassed over 9 million plays and generated more than $30,000 in revenue. Check it out here!

- **Web Development:** I've been diving into web development, participating in multiple hackathons, and currently have 4 wins under my belt. These experiences have sharpened my skills and fostered my creativity in building innovative projects.
- **Mobile Development:** During my internship at Blue Social, I worked with React Native to develop mobile applications. I’ve also worked on personal projects, such as a fitness tracker application, which allowed me to grow my skills and gain hands-on experience in mobile development.

## Technologies ⚡  
- Front-end development using **React, React Native, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS**.  
- Backend development using **Flask, Fastify (Node.js), and Java**.  
- Database management with **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL**.
